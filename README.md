# Console Game - Grid Movement
Welcome to the Console Game - Grid Movement! This is a simple Java console-based game where you navigate a player character ('p') within a grid using wasd keys.

Features
Simple grid-based gameplay.
Player movement using keyboard arrow keys ('w', 'a', 's', 'd').
Quit the game by pressing the 'q' key.

W: Move the player character up.
A: Move the player character left.
S: Move the player character down.
D: Move the player character right.
Q: Quit the game.

This is my first Java project and my first time uploading to GitHub! 
I appreciate constructive criticism as I am still learning.

Thank you!
